  With limited time we delivered visual designs for Husqvarna to represent what their future web presence could look like. This was a direct collaboration between marketeers, creative directors, copywriters and the designer, me. I introduced a sensible typographic hierarchy, reduced colours, the usage of iconography, better font sizes for legibility, increased whitespace for easier readability, and breathing space for the content.
<%= partial(:'partials/image', :locals => { :imageurl => "husqvarna/overview.jpg", :alt => current_page.title }) %>
<%= partial(:'partials/image', :locals => { :imageurl => "husqvarna/macbook.jpg", :alt => current_page.title }) %>

<%= partial(:'partials/image', :locals => { :imageurl => "husqvarna/home-page.jpg", :alt => current_page.title }) %>

  Home page

  Our thinking behind the homepage was to put extra focus on the inspirational stories and knowledge content for the users, because they are less likely to have a set goal at this point in the journey. But catering for the minority of users with a clear goal we included entires to the different product lines.

<%= partial(:'partials/image', :locals => { :imageurl => "husqvarna/product-page.jpg", :alt => current_page.title }) %>

  The product details page focuses on bringing out contextual stories with the product involved. The user can watch a promotional video of a forestry worker using the Husqvarna chainsaw, read reviews, see related products and also at the end of the page there is a call to action to find a dealer.

  The product listing page features filters and slider to allow the user to find the right tool for the job.

  We did what we could in the limited timeframe â€“ however the fact the we won the client meant that our ideas and designs still resonated positively with Husqvarna. The pitch was a start of a bigger conversation between the client and DigitasLBi. And from there the design took off into production, with major changes to the layout but the DNA still intact. Unfortunately I wasnt part of the production phase, I only produced the vision, but I'm happy to see the essence is still there on the live site.
