  The core values for Volvo Cars is simplicity, functionality and durability. Volvos Scandinavian heritage is an integral part of the brand and we wanted to create a website which mirrors all these values through an modern and aesthetic web experience.

  The website, fully responsive is packed with bits of configurators that the user can interact with, such as changing the paint, rims, interior upholstery, entertainment systems, and engine specifications on the go as the user is scrolling down the module-based design.
