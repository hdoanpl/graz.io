# My role:

- Interviewing the users.
- Document findings


# Context

During my time at This Place we were given the task to optimise the checkout process for a online grocery store. In fact the goal was to reduce to the checkout flow to only take a minute to do, given that the user was logged in.

> Simply put; Give users a prototype >  Listen to feedback > Iterate > Repeat.  

Do help us with this task we decided early that we wanted to do qualitative user research paired with rapid prototyping. With this combination of UX techniques we we're able to test the designs and iterate upon them depending on the user feedback we gathered via **interviews** and **A/B testing**.
