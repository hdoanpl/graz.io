    The HeyPlace app was a result of a 12-hour Hackathon. The app was planned weeks ahead the event so when the time came we had a pretty solid scaffold that we could work from. We had the servers set up and ready to send requests to and from our app, the HTML scaffold was build, even a basic design groundwork was put together. To put it short, we had a MVP version working before the event even started (but don't tell anyone). That said we still had to put the pieces together in mere 12 hours.

    Below you'll find some designs for the proof-of-concept app. The actual app looks a bit different today
