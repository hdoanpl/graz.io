  :textBlock: "It’s been roughly 3 years since I launched my previous portfolio. While
    my old site received a great deal of positive feedback and won various features
    and awards, I still wanted a new portfolio to reflect the current me.\n\n# Tech
    bits\n\nI knew from the inception of the project that this website had to be written
    from scratch so that I could have 100% control over it.\n\nFor this portfolio
    I used Middleman which is a static site generator written in Ruby which spits
    out static pages that are ready to be deployed. Because the pages are static the
    website becomes very lightweight and reliable. \n\nMiddleman out-of-the-box allows
    for SCSS and HAML and other sexy technologies to be used. But I decided to keep
    it lean to reduce as many dependencies as possible.\n\nI deploy my portfolio via
    Netlify, which allows me to reap their CDN locations which gives blazing fast
    load times.\n\nIgnoring CSS frameworks kept the stylesheets lean, not to mention
    I would find it hard to apply them to this quite straightforward layout.\n\n#
    Design bits\n\nI wanted to the design to be very sharp and ungimmicky. Displaying
    only the elements you really need to see. I targeted design-interested people
    with desktops \n> Analytics shows that 92% of my audience is browsing the website
    from a Desktop device \n\n— Therefore I put extra care catering the desktop experience
    of the site, making sure it looked as good as possible on the big screen. \n\n\n\nThe
    staple of the website is what I call the Tile:\n\n<ul class=\"tiles mt-s mb-s\">\n
    \ <li class=\"reveal tile\" style=\"list-style:none; min-width:208px; margin:0
    auto;\">\n    <div class=\"tile-content\" data-color=\"#6F006A\">\n      <h2><span>I
    am a tile</span> on :hover</h2>\n      <span>Yep, this a tile</span>\n    </div>\n\n
    \   <div class=\"tile-bg\" data-bgcolor=\"#a9e98b\">\n      <div class=\"tile-image\">\n
    \       <img src=\"/images/avo.png\" alt=\"\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nOther
    than being a sweet tile it can hold an image on mouseover as well as displaying
    additional text.\n\nThe tile spatially aware so it will never expand towards the
    edge of the screen. Try downsizing the window on the homepage to see the effect.\n\nThe
    tiles change to a stacked design on mobile viewports.\n\n# Typography bits\n\nThe
    font I'm using is called GT-Cinetype. It's absolutely gorge. Do zoom in to see
    the jagged edges of the font.\n\n<span style=\"font-size:24rem; line-height:20rem;\">R<span>\n\nI
    increased the body font size considerably since my last portfolio. This was to
    force myself to write shorter sentences. I personally believe it's better to write
    concise & powerful sentences rather than over-explaining things.\n\n# End bits\n\nHopeful
    this new portfolio will serve me for longer than 6 weeks before I grow bored of
    it again. As of writing this article I am happy how it turned out — if you are
    curious about it's creation you can have a look at the source code here: [Link
