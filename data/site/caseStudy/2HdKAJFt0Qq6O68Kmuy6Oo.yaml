  :textBlock: "When someone is unfamiliar with Delhaize I usually compare it to Waitrose,
    but in Belgium. It draws a pretty good picture of what Delhaize is — A modern
    grocery store on the pricey-side of the scale.  \n\nDuring my time at This Place,
    I had the opportunity to work on a number projects with Delhaize. Most notably,
    the complete redesign of the whole website to be more responsive & usable. Yet
    my favourite project was guerrilla-testing the checkout process with real users.
    \n\n\nThe Challenge.\n\n- Handling multiple browser sizes, which are nearing infinity
    in different combinations \n- The UI had to consider many different languages,
    even non-latin ones like Greek \n- The design had to conform to the different
    markets which in turn had their own design language \n- The site itself had to
    load reliably on spotty connections, given the surge of mobile users \n- And it
    had to be easy to use and not frustrate the users\n\nA keen designer can learn
    much from a vast project like this when there are that many aspects to consider.
    \n\nWhen we started this monster of a project, the first natural step for us was
    to analyse the competitors. At the time we realised that most big-brand grocery
    stores in the UK didn't have a responsive website.  \n\nSure some of them had
    a separate mobile version. But never a responsive website with viewports ranging
    all the way from desktop to mobile. We we're on our own. \n\nParallel to this
    project, Delhaize launched an initiative to innovate their checkout process. Namely,
    they wanted it to be more snappy and faster on mobile devices."
