  :textBlock: With limited time we delivered visual designs for Husqvarna to represent
    what their future web presence could look like. This was a direct collaboration
    between marketeers, creative directors, copywriters and the designer, me. I introduced
    a sensible typographic hierarchy, reduced colours, the usage of iconography, better
    font sizes for legibility, increased whitespace for easier readability, and breathing
    space for the content.
