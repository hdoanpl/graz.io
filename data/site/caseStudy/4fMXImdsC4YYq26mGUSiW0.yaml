    Back in 2014 during my time at DigitasLBi I was part of the pitch team to design a future Volvo website.

    The core values for Volvo Cars is simplicity, functionality and durability. Volvos Scandinavian heritage is an integral part of the brand and we wanted to create a website which mirrors all these values through an modern and aesthetic web experience.
