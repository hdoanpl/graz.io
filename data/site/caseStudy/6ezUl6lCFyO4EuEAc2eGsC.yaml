  :textBlock: Indulging into the world of poetry can be quite daunting especially
    for an audience with increasingly short web-attention. At This Place we came up
    with a fresh way to introduce poetry for a new audience - through Memes. In other
    words, a hand-picked poem verse pasted onto an image. With the idea of it being
    shared online

    a random poetry verse matched with Memes that correspond with the verse displayed.
    It's a smart way to show what the website is about at a glance. Reading poetry

    # Test

    The poem page was designed to achieve two things: reading poetry and creating Memes. The user may create a Meme by either selecting the text, or be guided into creating a meme by clicking the create Meme button, which will automatically select the first verse.
